# Kevin Holt - Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site built using HTML, CSS/Sass, Bootstrap and Javascript.

Some notable features:
* Fully mobile responsive with a collapsible side navigation
* last.fm API (https://www.last.fm/api/) used display the song I'm either currently listening to or most recently listened to in real-time
* Scroll-down and scroll-to-top buttons that dynamically displays based on the user's scroll position
* CSS hover effects
